# lunar_lander
 This project implements a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to control a Lunar Lander in the LunarLander-v3 environment using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Unlike traditional training setups, this implementation features adaptive hyperparameter tuning, which dynamically adjusts key training parameters to optimize learning efficiency.  The model is trained using Stable-Baselines3's PPO, leveraging parallel environments and GPU acceleration for fast convergence. Additionally, the system supports periodic evaluations and automatic model checkpointing, making it robust for long-term training.
